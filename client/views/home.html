        China is facing severe problems on environmental pollution and food safety. The traditional Dose-Response is being challenged by the combination effects and low-dose effects of toxic substances. Currently, even the most advanced toxicity evaluation systems, such as Tox 21 program in US, are only based on single pure chemical and they are not focusing on how to quickly identify unknown toxic chemicals and evaluate the combined toxic effects from a real complex sample. We propose to integrate chemical analysis with bio-analytical systems for toxicity evaluations on real samples with low-dose exposure, and identification of unknown toxic chemicals. With the development of novel signaling pathway-based biosensors and establishment of effect-directed toxic chemical screening and identification systems, the present proposal aims to develop a high-throughput integrated toxicology analyzer in order to set up a technical platform for effective and efficient evaluation of combined toxic effects and discovery of emerging toxic chemicals. This system will serve as an important technical support for environment protection and food safety poison analysis in China, and quickly identify the main toxic substances with their concentrations and toxicity in an incident.

        We compiled a large library containing 533 drug relevant targets with 179,807 active ligands, where each target was defined by its ligand set. For a given query molecule, its target profile is generated by similarity searching against the ligand sets assigned to each target, for which individual searches utilizing multiple reference structures are then fused into a single ranking list representing the potential target interaction profile of the query compound.
